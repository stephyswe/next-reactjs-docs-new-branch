title: Describing the UI
---

<Intro>

React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI). UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and images. React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable *components.* From web sites to phone apps, everything on the screen can be broken down into components. In this chapter, you'll learn to create, customize, and conditionally display React components.

## Your first component {/*your-first-component*/}

React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called *components*. A React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. Components can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. Here is a `Gallery` component rendering three `Profile` components:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```css
img { margin: 0 10px 10px 0; height: 90px; }
```

</Sandpack>

## Importing and exporting components {/*importing-and-exporting-components*/}

You can declare many components in one file, but large files can get difficult to navigate. To solve this, you can *export* a component into its own file, and then *import* that component from another file:


<Sandpack>

```js App.js hidden
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Gallery />
  );
}
```

```js Gallery.js active
import Profile from './Profile.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```js Profile.js
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}
```

```css
img { margin: 0 10px 10px 0; }
```

</Sandpack>
