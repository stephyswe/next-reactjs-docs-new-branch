title: Thinking in React
---

<Intro>

React can change how you think about the designs you look at and the apps you build. When you build a user interface with React, you will first break it apart into pieces called *components.* Then, you will describe the different visual states for each of your components. Finally, you will connect your components together so that the data flows through them. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table with React.

</Intro>

## Start with the mockup {/*start-with-the-mockup*/}

Imagine that you already have a JSON API and a mockup from a designer.

The JSON API returns some data that looks like this:

```json
[
  { category: "Fruits", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Apple" },
  { category: "Fruits", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Dragonfruit" },
  { category: "Fruits", price: "$2", stocked: false, name: "Passionfruit" },
  { category: "Vegetables", price: "$2", stocked: true, name: "Spinach" },
  { category: "Vegetables", price: "$4", stocked: false, name: "Pumpkin" },
  { category: "Vegetables", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Peas" }
]
```

The mockup looks like this:

<img src="/images/docs/s_thinking-in-react_ui.png" width="300" style={{margin: '0 auto'}} />

To implement a UI in React, you will usually follow the same five steps.

## Step 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy {/*step-1-break-the-ui-into-a-component-hierarchy*/}

Start by drawing boxes around every component and subcomponent in the mockup and naming them. If you work with a designer, they may have already named these components in their design tool. Check in with them!

Depending on your background, you can think about splitting up a design into components in different ways:

* **Programming**--use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents. 
* **CSS**--consider what you would make class selectors for. (However, components are a bit less granular.)
* **Design**--consider how you would organize the design's layers.

If your JSON is well-structured, you'll often find that it naturally maps to the component structure of your UI. That's because UI and data models often have the same information architecture--that is, the same shape. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.

There are five components on this screen:

<CodeDiagram flip>

<img src="/images/docs/s_thinking-in-react_ui_outline.png" width="500" style={{margin: '0 auto'}} />

1. `FilterableProductTable` (grey) contains the entire app.
2. `SearchBar` (blue) receives the user input.
3. `ProductTable` (lavender) displays and filters the list according to the user input.
4. `ProductCategoryRow` (green) displays a heading for each category.
5. `ProductRow`	(yellow) displays a row for each product.

</CodeDiagram>

</FullWidth>

If you look at `ProductTable` (lavender), you'll see that the table header (containing the "Name" and "Price" labels) isn't its own component. This is a matter of preference, and you could go either way. For this example, it is a part of `ProductTable` because it appears inside the `ProductTable`'s list. However, if this header grows to be complex (e.g., if you add sorting), it would make sense to make this its own `ProductTableHeader` component.

Now that you've identified the components in the mockup, arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mockup should appear as a child in the hierarchy:

* `FilterableProductTable`
    * `SearchBar`
    * `ProductTable`
        * `ProductCategoryRow`
        * `ProductRow`

## Step 2: Build a static version in React {/*step-2-build-a-static-version-in-react*/}

Now that you have your component hierarchy, it's time to implement your app. The most straightforward approach is to build a version that renders the UI from your data model without adding any interactivity... yet! It's often easier to build the static version first and then add interactivity separately. Building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, but adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.

To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you'll want to build [components](/learn/your-first-component) that reuse other components and pass data using [props.](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) Props are a way of passing data from parent to child. (If you're familiar with the concept of [state](/learn/state-a-components-memory), don't use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don't need it.)

You can either build "top down" by starting with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (like `FilterableProductTable`) or "bottom up" by working from components lower down (like `ProductRow`). In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up.

```jsx App.js
function ProductCategoryRow({ category }) {
  return (
    <tr>
      <th colSpan="2">
        {category}
      </th>
    </tr>
  );
}

function ProductRow({ product }) {
  const name = product.stocked ? product.name :
    <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>
      {product.name}
    </span>;

  return (
    <tr>
      <td>{name}</td>
      <td>{product.price}</td>
    </tr>
  );
}

function ProductTable({ products }) {
  const rows = [];
  let lastCategory = null;

  products.forEach((product) => {
    if (product.category !== lastCategory) {
      rows.push(
        <ProductCategoryRow
          category={product.category}
          key={product.category} />
      );
    }
    rows.push(
      <ProductRow
        product={product}
        key={product.name} />
    );
    lastCategory = product.category;
  });

  return (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Price</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>{rows}</tbody>
    </table>
  );
}

function SearchBar() {
  return (
    <form>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Search..." />
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox" />
        {' '}
        Only show products in stock
      </label>
    </form>
  );
}

function FilterableProductTable({ products }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <SearchBar />
      <ProductTable products={products} />
    </div>
  );
}

const PRODUCTS = [
  {category: "Fruits", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Apple"},
  {category: "Fruits", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Dragonfruit"},
  {category: "Fruits", price: "$2", stocked: false, name: "Passionfruit"},
  {category: "Vegetables", price: "$2", stocked: true, name: "Spinach"},
  {category: "Vegetables", price: "$4", stocked: false, name: "Pumpkin"},
  {category: "Vegetables", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Peas"}
];

export default function App() {
  return <FilterableProductTable products={PRODUCTS} />;
}
```

```css
body {
  padding: 5px
}
label {
  display: block;
  margin-top: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}
th {
  padding-top: 10px;
}
td {
  padding: 2px;
  padding-right: 40px;
}
```

(If this code looks intimidating, go through the [Quick Start](/learn/) first!)

After building your components, you'll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. Because this is a static app, the components will only return JSX. The component at the top of the hierarchy (`FilterableProductTable`) will take your data model as a prop. This is called _one-way data flow_ because the data flows down from the top-level component to the ones at the bottom of the tree.

<Pitfall>

At this point, you should not be using any state values. That’s for the next step!

</Pitfall>

## Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state {/*step-3-find-the-minimal-but-complete-representation-of-ui-state*/}

To make the UI interactive, you need to let users change your underlying data model. You will use *state* for this.

Think of state as the minimal set of changing data that your app needs to remember. The most important principle for structuring state is to keep it [DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else on-demand. For example, if you're building a shopping list, you can store the items as an array in state. If you want to also display the number of items in the list, don't store the number of items as another state value--instead, read the length of your array.

Now think of all of the pieces of data in this example application:

1. The original list of products
2. The search text the user has entered
3. The value of the checkbox
4. The filtered list of products

Which of these are state? Identify the ones that are not:

* Does it **remain unchanged** over time? If so, it isn't state.
* Is it **passed in from a parent** via props? If so, it isn't state.
* **Can you compute it** based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it *definitely* isn't state!

What's left is probably state.

Let's go through them one by one again:

1. The original list of products is **passed in as props, so it's not state.** 
2. The search text seems to be state since it changes over time and can't be computed from anything.
3. The value of the checkbox seems to be state since it changes over time and can't be computed from anything.
4. The filtered list of products **isn't state because it can be computed** by taking the original list of products and filtering it according to the search text and value of the checkbox.

This means only the search text and the value of the checkbox are state! Nicely done!

<DeepDive title="Props vs State">

There are two types of "model" data in React: props and state. The two are very different:

* [**Props** are like arguments you pass](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) to a function. They let a parent component pass data to a child component and customize its appearance. For example, a `Form` can pass a `color` prop to a `Button`.
* [**State** is like a component’s memory.](/learn/state-a-components-memory) It lets a component keep track of some information and change it in response to interactions. For example, a `Button` might keep track of `isHovered` state.

Props and state are different, but they work together. A parent component will often keep some information in state (so that it can change it), and *pass it down* to child components as their props. It's okay if the difference still feels fuzzy on the first read. It takes a bit of practice for it to really stick!
